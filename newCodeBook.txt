Tidy data Code Book
===================

This file was created from data available from 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones, original code book is available for more explicit description of the dataset.

Only variables related to mean and standard deviation of related quantities were used. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

For each subject test, average for each value and activity were calculated. 

activity: Descriptive activity name
subject: Subject number (1 to 30)
